# hush-bot

A multi-functional collection of bots integrated with **Discord**, **MS Teams**, and **Slack** focused
on helping you share secrets in an efficient and confidential way.

With a top down focus on administrative control and privacy, hosting any one of the bots
will also deploy a completely independent PostgreSQL database ready to hold all of your 
secrets. Secrets remain between shutdowns, but can be customized with lifetimes to expire
after a certain time frame.
